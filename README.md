1. Make sure you have Node and npm installed. 
2. Run ```npm install``` or ```npm i```
3. Then run ```npm run dev```

This will build the app, put ```index.html``` into the ```dist``` folder along with ```index.js```.

The app runs webpack dev server with hot reloading. So, any changes you make to ```index.js``` will rebuild the app.
